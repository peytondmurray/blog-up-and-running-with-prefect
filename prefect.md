# Getting started with Prefect: Build and run a pipeline locally

Prefect: open source library for scheduling and executing tasks
Prefect Cloud: Commercial service used for tracking and managing task execution

Prefect makes defining and executing many common tasks easy.

Here, we're going to create a pipeline and execute it in 3 steps:

1. Define _Tasks_ - individual functions which are executed as part of a task
   graph
2. Generate a _Flow_ - a collection of tasks executed in a well-defined order
3. _Run_ the flow
