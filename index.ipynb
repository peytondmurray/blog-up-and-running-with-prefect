    "# up and running with prefect\n",
    "Many types of computations can be broken down into subtasks, some of which may be resource-intensive or long-running, and which may fail at any time for multiple reasons. Being able to define tasks, chain them together, and monitor execution is a nontrivial part of any modern computational pipeline. However, most researchers, data scientists, and software engineers want to focus on solving big-picture questions without worrying about these kinds of bookkeeping details. In the past decade or so, several task management libraries have attempted to make task tracking easy for the programmer, with [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) and [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) being some of the most well known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefect is an open source workflow management library designed to make it simple for users to keep track of task execution with only minimal changes to their code. The first public release of prefect, v0.2.0, was in July of 2018, with the Prefect team releasing on a regular cadence ever since. [prefect.io](Prefect), the company behind the Prefect library (also known as [Prefect Core](https://www.prefect.io/core) in the official documentation), offers a cloud-based task management dashboard called [Prefect Cloud](https://www.prefect.io/cloud/) as their flagship product. By itself, the Prefect library is [open source](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect) and totally free to use. Today we'll explore some of `prefect`'s data structures by building a simple pipeline from the ground up. Along the way, we'll show how to\n",
    "\n",
    "* define the _tasks_ (read: functions) that will make up the pipeline\n",
    "* chain tasks together into a _flow_ as a way of defining their interdependencies\n",
    "* run the pipeline, and examine the output\n",
    "* visualize the task graph with `graphviz`\n",

    "## installation\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll need to install `prefect`; we'll also need [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/). For fake data, we'll use [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/):\n",

    "## the example: shipment cost calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine that we have a list of shipments; these parcels need to be classified according to whether they are shippable as-is, or oversize (and therefore subject to a higher fee). Finally, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the entire inventory. First, we'll import the required libraries and generate some example data."

Although this isn't the most complicated example, it successfully illustrates some of the core features of Prefect, and could be readily modified to tackle other more difficult problems. While [prefect.io](https://www.prefect.io/) certainly targets machine learning pipelines with its branding and documentation, Prefect could be useful for anything where task tracking is important - including research applications."
